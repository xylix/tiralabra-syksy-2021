# Weekly report for first development week

- Hours spent: 7

- Started from idea to implement parts of ZSTD / the Zstandard algorithm. After advice, decided to instead focus on simpler LZ compression and Huffmann encoding algorithms, which form the basis of Zstandard and many other modern compression algorithms.

- As required for week 1, the project's repository was created, the definition document was made and finished, the programming language selected.
	- Simple hello worlds were created for both the main files for the algorithms to implement and their test suites.

- I researched the LZ algorithms and Huffmann coding on wikipedia. Figured out some of the differences between LZ77, LZ78, LZW and other LZ implementations, and decided on LZW for this course. Found some pseudocode examples.

- The only thing that was difficult was the scoping of the project, but I already received help with it.

- Next I will start writing some tests, and then writing first parts of the proper program code. Currently I'm planning on starting with the Huffmann codec, since it seems like the one which's length to implement will be harder to estimate.
