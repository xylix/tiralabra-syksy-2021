# Weekly report for first development week

- Hours spent: 5

- Implemented LZW first, because after research into pseudocode's it seemed easy to get done to just sort of have something working already.

- LZW now has working unit tests, reaching 100% coverage when ignoring the purely-library code. (See [week2 coverage report](https://github.com/xylix/tiralabra-syksy-2021/blob/main/dokumentit/coverage_history/week2.txt))

- Reached some understanding of LZW, thought about what would be the optimal data structure for the "dictionary". Maybe an ordered hash set? Found an okay pseudo-code to use as reference when implementing Huffman.

- Scoping when to call it quits for week 2 and to start week 3.

- Add 1 big test for LZW (e.g. file that is some kilobytes in size), then start implementing Huffman.
