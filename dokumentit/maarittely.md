# Definition document

## Programming language:

Planning to use primarily Python.

I can peer review projects in Python, Javascript (/ Typescript), Rust, Java, Kotlin, and possibly Haskell (no promises if the code is complicated)


## Planned algorithms and data structures to use in the program:

For the Huffman coding python's hashmap implementation (dict) will be used. Heapq from the standard library may also be useful

## The problem to solve

Program and compare implementations of LZ78 and Huffman coding. They are both popular algorithms for lossless compression. If comparing is too simple, make use of the algorithms to implement a variant of Deflate.


##  Program inputs

* Both compression implementations will take in files and output either compressed or decompressed files based on the input type.



##  Tavoitteena olevat aika- ja tilavaativuudet (m.m. O-analyysit)

The compression % targets depend on the data set. The goal is to match some comparable implementation's compression % and have compatible input and output formats.

* Huffmann %
  * File 1:
  * File 2:

* LZW
  * File 1:
  * File 2:

Both algorithms are O(n) in their complexity, the use of hash-based data structures and necessity of only a single pass over the input data means that the execution time scales linearly.
