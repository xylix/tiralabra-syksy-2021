# Definition document

## Programming language:

Planning to use primarily Python.

I can peer review projects in Python, Javascript (/ Typescript), Rust, Java, Kotlin, and possibly Haskell (no promises if the code is complicated)


## Planned algorithms and data structures to use in the program:

For the Huffman coding python's hashmap implementation (dict) will be used. Heapq from the standard library may also be useful

## The problem to solve

Program and compare implementations of LZ78 and Huffman coding. They are both popular algorithms for lossless compression.


##  Program inputs

* Both compression implementations will take in files and output either compressed or decompressed files based on the input type.



##  Tavoitteena olevat aika- ja tilavaativuudet (m.m. O-analyysit)
