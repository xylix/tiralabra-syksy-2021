Program structure:
- src/ contains the program code
    - main.py is the main CLI and entry point for the program.
    - lzw.py is the implementation of the LZW compression algorithm
    - huffman.py is the implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm
    - utils/ contains a single utility file:
        - visualize_tree.py is a helper for printing tree data structures visually on the command line (found on stackoverflow)
            - Not in use currently, it prints quite large amount of rows and columns. But useful for figuring out what Huffman compression trees look like.

Performance, compression and O-analysis comparison:

- Huffman:
